"Right now, I'm in a state of mind"
I wanna be in like all the time
Ain't got no tears left to cry
"So I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up"
"I'm lovin', I'm livin' (oh, ay), I'm pickin' it up"
"I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up (yeah)"
"I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up (oh yeah)"
"I'm pickin' it up (yeah), pickin' it up (yeah, ay)"
"Lovin', I'm livin', so we turnin' up (we turnin' it up)"
"Yeah, we turnin' it up"
Ain't got no tears in my body
"I ran out, but, boy, I like it"
"I like it, I like it"
"Don't matter how, what, where, who tries it"
We out here vibin'
"We vibin', we vibin'"
Comin' out
Even when it's rainin' down
Can't stop now
"Can't stop, so shut your mouth"
Shut your mouth
"And if you don't know, then now you know it, babe"
"Know it, babe, yeah"
"Right now, I'm in a state of mind"
I wanna be in like all the time
Ain't got no tears left to cry
"So I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up (oh yeah)"
"I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up"
"Oh, I just want you to come with me (ooh)"
We on another mentality
Ain't got no tears left to cry (to cry)
"So, I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up (oh yeah)"
"I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up (oh)"
"Pickin' it up (yeah), pickin' it up (yeah, ay)"
"Lovin', I'm livin', so we turnin' up (we turnin' it up)"
"Yeah (yeah), we turnin' it up"
"They point out the colors in you, I see 'em too"
"And, boy, I like 'em"
"I like 'em, I like 'em"
We way too fly to partake in all this hate
We out here vibin'
"We vibin', we vibin'"
Comin' out
Even when it's rainin' down
Can't stop now
"Can't stop, so shut your mouth"
Shut your mouth
"And if you don't know, then now you know it, babe"
"Know it, babe, yeah"
"Right now, I'm in a state of mind"
I wanna be in like all the time
Ain't got no tears left to cry
"So I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up (oh yeah)"
"I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up"
"Oh, I just want you to come with me (ooh)"
We on another mentality (oh)
Ain't got no tears left to cry (to cry)
"So I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up (oh yeah)"
"I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up"
Comin' out
Even when it's rainin' down
Can't stop now (mm-oh)
Shut your mouth
Ain't got no tears left to cry
"Oh yeah, oh yeah"
"Oh, I just want you to come with me (me)"
We on another mentality
Ain't got no tears left to cry (cry)
"So I'm pickin' it up (yeah), pickin' it up (oh yeah)"
"I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up (pickin' it up)"
"Pickin' it up (mm), pickin' it up (mm)"
"Lovin', I'm livin', so we turnin' up (mm-hm)"
"Yeah, we turnin' it up"
