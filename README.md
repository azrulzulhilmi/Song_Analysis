## üìä Key Visualizations

### üìå Top Words Comparison (Without vs With Custom Stopwords)

This comparison highlights the impact of using a **custom stopword list** when analyzing song lyrics.

- **Without custom stopwords**, the most frequent words are often casual or filler (e.g., *yeah*, *aint*, *got*, *just*, *im*). These are common in pop music but do not carry much analytical meaning.  
- **With custom stopwords**, we get a clearer view of the **core themes and emotional content** of the lyrics. Words like *feel*, *love*, *body*, and *god* become more prominent, enhancing the interpretability of the analysis.

The word clouds below illustrate the most frequently used words across all five Ariana Grande songs.

- **Without custom stopword removal**, filler and informal words such as *yeah*, *aint*, *got*, and *just* dominate. These words are rhythmically important in lyrics but add noise in textual analysis.  
- **With custom stopwords removed**, the clouds reveal deeper, more meaningful vocabulary like *feel*, *love*, *baby*, and *god*. These highlight the core themes and emotions expressed in the songs more clearly.
